HTML-- website structure
CSS-- website styling

to protect the readability and maintainability of your HTML file, you can create a CSS file.

link CSS file to HTML file
<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">

1. HTML and CSS are kept in separate files in order to keep code maintainable and readable, as well as keep structure separate from styling.

2. The <style> element allows you to write CSS code within an HTML file.

3. A CSS stylesheet can be linked to an HTML file using the <link> element, which requires three attributes:

href - set equal to the path of the CSS file.
type - set equal to text/css.
rel - set equal to stylesheet.
